# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the thesis template. This template is based on (and in
many places copied directly from) the HU Berlin School of Business and Economics
LaTeX template, but hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that
have never used TeX or LaTeX before. Using _R Markdown_ will also allow you to
easily keep track of your analyses in **R** chunks of code, with the resulting
plots and output included as well.

**Why use it?**

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the
beauty of LaTeX.Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX
to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. _R Markdown_ also allows you
to read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R** functions,
and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project.  Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the commentary of your results.
