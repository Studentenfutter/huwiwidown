# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the thesis template. This template is based on (and in many places 
copied directly from) the HU Berlin School of Business and Economics LaTeX 
template, but hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that have
never used LaTeX before. Using _R Markdown_ will also allow you to easily keep
track of your analyses in **R** chunks of code, with the resulting plots and
output included as well.

## Why use it?

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the
beauty of LaTeX. Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX
to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. _R Markdown_ also allows you
to read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R** functions,
and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your
project. Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the
commentary of your results.
