Master's thesis for Phi Nguyen, MSc. Statistics at the Humboldt University in
Berlin.

__Research Question__: Is road usage pricing (congestion pricing) an effective
mechanism for reducing congestion in Berlin? If so, what is the optimal
congestion charge?

## Introduction

In 2016 in Berlin, the average driver spent over 44 hours in traffic, leading
to approximate 2800â‚¬ in wasted time and fuel costs (_INRIX Scorecard 2017_).

__Road usage pricing__ is a demand-side mechanism (price signal) that mitigates
congestion by inducing drivers to:

1. To drive at different times of the day
2. Use different modes of transport
3. Use less congested roads
