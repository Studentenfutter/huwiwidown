# About this Thesis Template {-}

Welcome to the thesis template. This template is based on (and in many places 
copied directly from) the HU Berlin School of Business and Economics LaTeX 
template, but hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that have
never used LaTeX before. 

## Why use R Markdown? {-}

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the
beauty of LaTeX. Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX
to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. 

_R Markdown_ also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to
visualize it using **R** functions, and also to provide the documentation and
commentary on the results of your project. Using _R Markdown_ will also allow
you to easily keep track of your analyses in **R** chunks of code, with the 
esulting plots and output included as well.
