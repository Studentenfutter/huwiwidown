This project provides a handy template for writing a dissertation or Bachelor's/
Master's Thesis at the Humboldt-Universit\"at zu Berlin School of Business and
Economics and rendering those files in a PDF format following the standard LaTeX
template found [here](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/professuren/vwl/oe/teaching/theses/latex-thesis-template/view).

Users write in the `RMarkdown` markup language (as opposed to LaTex) and then
the `bookdown` package in R is used to render the documents in a PDF format. In
the enent that you've never used `bookdown` before, check out the [handy
tutorial](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).
